Happy New Year!
I think that I have something interesting for you.

In parallel with the official(paid) work (work in financial banks, work in giant manufacturer of cellular communication, research institutes, nuclear power, pulsed systems, mathematics. Last work is related to robotics) I studied philosophy, logic and mathematics to analyze existing technologies and improve them. After more than 15 years of investigations (I started in 1995), I came to the conclusion that the accumulated data and experience give me the right to develop and introduce into practice some of the ideas.

I want to develop the new paradigm in IT development, which expectations are:
1. Interpreters of modern languages
1.1 human languages
1.2 programming language extensions to the logical completeness

2. Recognition of non-human interactions 
2.1 secure channels encrypted messages 
2.2 alien languages ??there is not similar to our form of life

3.Vernadsky's noosphere model 
3.1 Private secure communications without direct address (secure channel) messaging
3.2 Animated simulation of the behavior of artificial systems

I propose the joint development of a new paradigm in IT that will make the above expectations a reality
Unfortunately, life is short, and I can not spend more time on other projects other than to try to bring to the completed state idea of ??a new programming paradigm. That is why I need some recourses to stop my paid projects activities and paid all my time for paradigm's development.

More detailed presentation and my CV I may send you by e-mail. If this info will be interesting for you plese write me by e-mail.
